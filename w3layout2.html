        Fashion is the form of clothing, accessories, and furniture. It can be used by everyone. It is related to culture,
        <br>
         For
        example, we have warm clothes in the Swedish fashion and we have thin clothes
        <br> in the African fashion. Fashion is a
        source of looking better/attractive.
